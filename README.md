بِسْمِ ٱللَّٰهِ ٱلرَّحْمٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ
In the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful.

The heart of platform marketing is done by people or consumers, they share their value created by the platform for achieving incentives like joy, happiness, fame, honor, leader of the market etc. so the core feature for spreadable core value is through sharable values or some part قرآن (Qoran) .

As an example we achive some achivement and then we add a photo of achivement story to it and the content has some real state for advertising the platform.


In the domain of this application I suggest the storage to store Qoran it is better to exist (some bytes)
and people can search the book. you may ask yourself the state manager? the computer? why should I do this? Because we are human and not a machine, we have a soul and we can accept or reject an offer and we want to leave in the nature. 
Qoran is the best human user manual or documentation that ever existed, the book says humans created from the nothing , owns nothing and the seitan or the human enemey(اعوذ بالله من الشیطان الرجیم) knows the اللّه is exist.
